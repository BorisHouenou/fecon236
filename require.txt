#  require.txt :: mock requirements.txt for fecon236          Date : 2018-05-13
#    "$ pip install -r requirements.txt"
#
#  When we do continuous integration testing, we prefer the environment
#  created by conda, rather than by pip. Travis CI automatically installs
#  from requirements.txt when the language is Python -- which is something
#  we want to intentionally avoid for that reason. This is the developers'
#  preference, but the user may have different practices. So...
#  
#       =>  require.txt is designed to be COPIED as requirements.txt
#
#       for the bare essentials, which excludes software optimizations
#       such as MLK (Math Kernel Library) and LLVM, as well as
#       Jupyter notebook and IPython console.
#  
#  Please FORGET this file, if you already using the Anaconda distribution
#  for the numpy pandas stack -- those optimizations are included effortlessly.
#  Take a glance at the bottom of this file, if you need to supplement your
#  Miniconda distribution. And remember to get pip from conda:
#  
#       conda install pip virtualenv
$
#       pip install fecon236
#       pip install --upgrade fecon236
#       pip uninstall fecon236

#  _______________ Background
#  
#  Whereas "install_requires" requirements in setup.py are Abstract,
#  i.e. not associated with any particular index,
#  requirements files often contain pip options like --index-url
#  or --find-links to make requirements Concrete, i.e.
#  associated with a particular index or directory of packages.
#  Whereas "install_requires" metadata in setup.py is automatically
#  analyzed by pip during an install, requirements files are NOT,
#  and only are used when a user specifically installs them
#  using "pip install -r requirements.txt".

#       #  E.g. IMPLICIT value for concreteness:
#       --index-url https://pypi.python.org/simple/
#       #  But compare to --extra-index-url
#  
#       #  E.g. Installing the bar library from 
#       #      https://github.com/foo/bar.git,
#       #  making it equal to the name "bar":
#       -e https://github.com/foo/bar.git#egg=bar
