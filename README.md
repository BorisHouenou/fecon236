### Currently in development: ALPHA status

***Python3 refactoring of straddling fecon235 source code (not notebooks).***

See full details: https://github.com/rsvp/fecon235/issues/9

The **develop** branch is experimental where pull requests are currently directed.
The **master** branch is protected and will be released via 
`pip` and `conda` before the 2020-01-01 deadline.

The home for our ***Jupyter notebooks*** shall remain at
[fecon235](https://github.com/rsvp/fecon235) due to their bulky size.
Migration to the python3 kernel should have no problems
since fecon235 is compatible with both python27 and python3.
End users will be able to simply `import fecon236 as fe` 
as a drop-in replacement.
